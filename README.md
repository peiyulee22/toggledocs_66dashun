# ToggleDocs: Smarter, Faster, Maintainable Documentation

## Track & Problem Statement

Problem Statement: Fix the Docs: Smarter, Faster, Maintainable Documentation for the Real World by iFAST

In real-world tech environments, documentation is a critical but broken part of the software development lifecycle. Writing it is slow, repetitive, and often skipped. Reading it is painful, especially for new joiners. Maintaining it is impractical in fast-changing systems — documentation quickly becomes outdated, misleading, or irrelevant.

This leads to onboarding delays, wasted engineering time, and avoidable bugs.

ToggleDocs addresses this by providing a smart documentation assistant that integrates directly into developers’ workflows.

## Why ToggleDocs?

Java documentation gets outdated the moment you refactor methods or add parameters. ToggleDocs monitors your code and keeps Javadocs, README files, and API docs synchronized.

## Key Features

- Java Code Monitoring
- Tracks method updates, class renames, and parameter changes in real-time.
- Method signature tracking, class structure analysis, parameter monitoring.
- Smart Documentation Suggestions
- Auto-generates Javadoc comments.
- Keeps README files synchronized.
- Updates API documentation.
- Dual Platform Support

VS Code Extension: inline documentation & sidebar suggestions.
Browser Extension: Docs Copilot for summaries (TL;DR), Q&A, and suggested updates.

## Demo & Prototype

What you’ll see:

- VS Code Simulator showing real-time Java monitoring.
- Docs Copilot with TL;DR summaries, Q&A, and suggested doc updates.
- Auto-generated Javadoc comments applied to Java classes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
